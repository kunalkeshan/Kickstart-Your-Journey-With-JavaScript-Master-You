# Vanilla JavaScript

Over here there are two ways you can learn the basics,

- From the Browser (Install the Live Server Extension mentioned above)
- From your Terminal (Install Node.js mentioned above)

## ðŸ’» From the browser

- Hopefully, you're using VS Code here and have installed the Live Server Extension. Simply click on `Go Live` and navigate to the `Vanilla-JavaScript` folder in the browser.
- If you've not installed it, it's not an issue, simple drag and drop the `index.html` file in the `Vanilla-JavaScript` folder to get started or open the file using a browser.

| Using VS Code | Drag and Drop |
| --- | --- |
| ![Go Live](../assets/go-live.jpg) | ![Drag and Drop](../assets/drag-n-drop.jpg) |
| ![Navigate to folder](../assets/navigate-to-folder.jpg) | |

From here on you can check the topics resources and how the code actually works for each topic.
