//  - Using the browser (JS file must be linked to the HTML file)
//  - Run outside of the browser using a runtime environment like Node.js

// A statement is a line of instruction that does a certain activity
// In the below line, the console statement prints to the browser console
// or the terminal if run on node.js
console.log('Hello, World!');

// It's not compulsory, but placing it is always considered a good practice.
